That is why we decided to build FoodPoint, a connected platform bringing local farmers and local people who are in need, together.\r\n\r\n### Technologies\r\nObjective-C, Google Maps API, FireBase API, NodeJS, JSON, SendGrid API\r\n\r\n### How it works\r\nBuyers who wish to find local food in their area would simply press the Buy button, enter in their name and email information, and their position in the world will be logged. In addition, Buyers have the option to be added to the list of a preexisting Farmer's Market, allowing Farmers to determine which areas are the most populated areas to sell. Buyers will receive updates from that particular trending farmer's market when the market has reached more than a certain number of farmers. On the other hand, sellers/farmers press the Sell Button and enter in their name and email information. They not only will be able to see every buyer's location, but preexisting markets that they can join. Once they join a preexisting market, a confirmation email is sent to them.\r\n\r\nWe used the iOS as the native application platform. We used FireBase's API to store the informations about Buyers, Sellers, and Markets, as well as the latitude and longitude of each object. We also used a Node.js server to not only process the FireBases's data and remove any unnecessary data, but be the intermediate step to sending emails through the SendGrid API. To make an email call, the iPhone stores a request full of information about the event and the person is attending the event. This data is stored into Firebase which is immediately tracked by our Node.js server that parses the information, sends an email to the recipients, and then deletes the request from Firebase after it is done.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nDiva Hurtado\r\n - Email: \r\n - LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/in/divahurtado\r\n - GitHub: \r\n\r\nBrian Wang \r\n - Email: brianwang9100@gmail.com\r\n - LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/in/brianwang9100\r\n - GitHub: www.github.com/brianwang9100\r\n\r\nMatt O'Hagan\r\n - Email: ohaganmatt@gmail.com\r\n - LinkedIn: \r\n - GitHub: https://github.com/mattohagan\r\n\r\nTrevor Overman\r\n - Email: troverman@gmail.com\r\n - LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/troverman\r\n - GitHub: https://github.com/troverman\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
